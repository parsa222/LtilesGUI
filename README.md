# LtilesGUI

This python script shows how you can fill a \(2^n \times 2^n\) square with L-shaped tiles, with one tile removed initially. The project uses a recursive algorithm to solve the tiling problem with a graphical user interface built with Tkinter module.

## Recursion Function

here is the link to the recursive Function ([click me](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tiling-problem-using-divide-and-conquer-algorithm/)).

## Description

- The tiling of a \(2^n times 2^n\)-1 grid using L-shaped tiles with a recursive algorithm.
- An interactive GUI that allows users to visualize the tiling process in real-time.

## Usage
download **main.py**
```bash
  python main.py
```




## bugs
for now n can not be more than 7 because of the way the array was initialized. (i'll fix it later on the second version with other features)

if you have any suggestions for improvements feel free to open an issue.
